Codecademy Capstone Project

This is my capstone project for the Codecademy Build Website from Scratch  course.  It is the first site I have written from scratch. It was an exercise for practicing html and css using flexbox, responsive design and transitions. Some things could be accomplished in multiple ways and you may see that I used different ways of doing the same things throughout the code. I did my best to remove inefficient and redundant code but I'm sure it could be greatly improved.

Please feel free to contact me with questions/comments/suggestions/criticisms.  I appreciate any and all feedback.  Thanks.

Hugh
